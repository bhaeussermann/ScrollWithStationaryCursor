# ScrollWithStationaryCursor

A Visual Studio 2017 extension for having the cursor move along as you scroll in the text editor.

## Features

Adds commands that allow to scroll up or down in the text editor while having the (keyboard) cursor move along. For every line that you scroll up, the cursor will move one line up, and similarly when scrolling down. Because the cursor moves along as you scroll, it will remain the same distance from the top or bottom of the editor.

## Commands

- `Edit.ScrollWithCursorUp` (default key binding: `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Up`)
- `Edit.ScrollWithCursorDown` (default key binding: `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Down`)
